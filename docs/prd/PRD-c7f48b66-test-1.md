Okay, here's a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your "test 1" project, based on the conversation history. Since the initial conversation was very brief and only provided a project title and description, I've had to make some reasonable assumptions to flesh out the document. In a real-world scenario, I'd ask many more probing questions to gather the necessary detail.

### 1. Executive Summary

"test 1" is a foundational project aimed at [**ASSUMPTION: I'm assuming a simple, internal-facing tool for demonstration or learning purposes given the placeholder nature of the input.**]. This document outlines the initial requirements and scope for the development of "test 1", focusing on [**ASSUMPTION: providing a basic, interactive experience.**]. The core objective is to deliver a minimal viable product (MVP) that addresses key user needs related to [**ASSUMPTION: interacting with a simple system and receiving immediate feedback.**]. This PRD details the functional and non-functional specifications, user stories, and acceptance criteria necessary to guide the development team.

### 2. Project Overview

**2.1 Project Name:** test 1

**2.2 Project Description:**
This is a test project designed to [**ASSUMPTION: serve as a simple, illustrative example of a web application or interactive tool.**] Its primary purpose is to [**ASSUMPTION: demonstrate basic UI/UX principles and backend interaction without complex business logic.**]

**2.3 Goals & Objectives:**
*   **Primary Goal:** To successfully deploy a functional, albeit simple, interactive application.
*   **Objective 1:** To define clear requirements for a rudimentary software project.
*   **Objective 2:** To gain experience in the end-to-end development lifecycle for a small project.
*   **Objective 3:** To provide a base for future, more complex feature development or learning.

**2.4 Target Users:**
*   **Primary Users:** Internal Development Team, Project Stakeholders, Testers.
*   **Secondary Users (Potential Future):** Users interested in a minimalist interactive experience (e.g., students, internal employees for simple tasks).

**2.5 Problems Solved:**
*   **Problem 1 (Current):** Lack of a tangible, simple project to test new technologies or development processes.
*   **Problem 2 (Current):** Need for a basic interactive prototype for demonstration purposes.
*   **Problem 3 (Future Potential):** Providing a simple, accessible tool for [**ASSUMPTION: basic data entry or information retrieval in a controlled environment.**]

**2.6 Scope:**
This initial phase of "test 1" will focus on delivering a basic interactive web application with minimal features. Future iterations may expand functionality based on learned experiences and evolving requirements. Out of scope for this phase: advanced analytics, complex user authentication (beyond basic local storage), third-party integrations, and internationalization.

### 3. Functional Requirements

The system shall:

*   **FR-1:** Display a welcoming message on the main page.
*   **FR-2:** Provide a text input field for users to enter a single line of text.
*   **FR-3:** Include a "Submit" button to process the entered text.
*   **FR-4:** Upon submission, display the entered text back to the user in a designated output area.
*   **FR-5:** Clear the input field after successful submission.
*   **FR-6:** Present a simple "About" page containing project information.

---

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

**4.1 Performance:**
*   **NFR-1.1:** The application should load within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
*   **NFR-1.2:** Response time for submitting text should be under 1 second.

**4.2 Security:**
*   **NFR-2.1:** No sensitive user data will be collected or stored in this initial version.
*   **NFR-2.2:** Basic input sanitization should be implemented to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., XSS for displaying user-entered data).

**4.3 Usability:**
*   **NFR-3.1:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users.
*   **NFR-3.2:** Clear feedback messages should be provided for user actions (e.g., success message on submission).

**4.4 Reliability:**
*   **NFR-4.1:** The application should have an uptime of 99.5% during development and testing phases.
*   **NFR-4.2:** Error messages should be user-friendly and provide actionable information where applicable.

**4.5 Scalability:**
*   **NFR-5.1:** The initial architecture should be designed to allow for future expansion of features (e.g., adding user accounts, more complex data processing).

**4.6 Maintainability:**
*   **NFR-6.1:** Codebase should be well-documented and follow established coding standards.
*   **NFR-6.2:** Dependencies should be clearly managed and up-to-date.

**4.7 Compatibility:**
*   **NFR-7.1:** The web application should function correctly on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - current and previous major versions).

---

### 5. User Stories

Here are some initial user stories to illustrate the key interactions:

*   **As a user, I want to see a welcoming message when I first visit the page, so I know I've arrived at the correct place.**
*   **As a user, I want to be able to type text into an input field, so I can contribute information to the system.**
*   **As a user, I want to click a "Submit" button after entering text, so my input is processed.**
*   **As a user, I want to see the text I just submitted displayed on the page, so I can confirm it was received.**
*   **As a user, I want the input field to clear after submission, so I can easily enter new text.**
*   **As a user, I want to access an "About" page, so I can learn more about the project.**

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

**AC-1: Display Welcome Message**
*   **Given** a user navigates to the application's root URL,
*   **Then** a prominent welcome message (e.g., "Welcome to test 1!") should be displayed on the page.

**AC-2: Text Input and Submission**
*   **Given** a user is on the main page,
*   **When** the user types "Hello World" into the input field and clicks the "Submit" button,
*   **Then** "Hello World" should appear in a designated output area,
*   **And** the input field should become empty.

**AC-3: Empty Input Submission**
*   **Given** a user is on the main page,
*   **When** the user clicks the "Submit" button with an empty input field,
*   **Then** no new text should be displayed in the output area,
*   **And** the input field should remain empty.
*   **(Optional: And) An error message "Input cannot be empty" should be displayed.**

**AC-4: "About" Page Access**
*   **Given** a user is on any page of the application,
*   **When** the user clicks on the "About" link/button,
*   **Then** the "About" page content (e.g., project description, version) should be displayed.

**AC-5: Input Sanitation (Basic)**
*   **Given** a user enters malicious script like `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` into the input field and submits it,
*   **Then** the script should *not* execute,
*   **And** the displayed output should either sanitize the input (e.g., display `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;`) or completely strip special characters.

### 7. Technical Considerations

**7.1 Architecture:**
*   **Front-end:** Single-page application (SPA) using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or plain HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity.
*   **Back-end:** [**ASSUMPTION: Given the simple requirements, a very light or no backend may suffice, or a mock API for demonstration.**] If a backend is needed, a lightweight framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask) for basic API endpoints. For this MVP, storing data in memory or local storage is sufficient.
*   **Data Storage:** Local storage for client-side persistence, or in-memory if no persistence is required.

**7.2 Technology Stack (Proposed):**
*   **Front-end:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js (or similar)
*   **Build Tools:** Webpack (or Vite, Parcel)
*   **Package Manager:** npm / yarn
*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **Deployment:** Static hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) if no backend, or a simple cloud VM if a backend is introduced.

**7.3 Integrations:**
*   None required for the MVP.

**7.4 Hosting:**
*   To be determined, but a cost-effective solution suitable for a small-scale web app is preferred.

**7.5 Logging & Monitoring:**
*   Basic console logging for development purposes. No advanced monitoring needed for MVP.
