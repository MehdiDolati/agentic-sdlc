# PRD Template - First PRD Content

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the "First PRD Content" feature. This feature aims to establish a basic, executable API endpoint that can be used for initial development and testing of a new product or service.

## 2. Problem Statement

When starting a new software project, developers often face a cold start without a readily available API endpoint to interact with. This lack of an operational endpoint hinders front-end development, integration testing, and the overall iterative development process, leading to delays and increased friction.

## 3. Goals

*   **Provide a foundational API endpoint:** Offer a simple, working API endpoint that returns a predictable response.
*   **Enable early front-end development:** Allow front-end teams to begin integration work and mock data interaction without waiting for complex backend logic.
*   **Facilitate basic API testing:** Provide a target for initial API health checks and integration tests.
*   **Demonstrate API infrastructure readiness:** Verify that the API deployment and hosting infrastructure is functional.

## 4. Non-Goals

*   **Complex business logic:** This feature will not implement any sophisticated business logic or data manipulation.
*   **Database integration:** There will be no database interaction or persistence as part of this initial endpoint.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Security mechanisms will not be implemented with this basic endpoint.
*   **Advanced error handling:** Error handling will be minimal, primarily focusing on successful responses.
*   **Comprehensive data models:** The data returned will be simple and static.

## 5. Success Criteria

*   A `GET /hello` API endpoint is deployed and accessible via a defined base URL.
*   Invoking `GET /hello` successfully returns a JSON object with a single key `message` and the value `"Hello from the API!"`.
*   Latency for `GET /hello` is consistently below 100ms.
*   The API endpoint has 99.9% uptime during initial testing.
*   Developers can successfully make requests to the endpoint and receive the expected response.
