# Simple Project

## 1. Problem
The current system lacks a very basic, foundational project that can serve as a starting point for future, more complex initiatives. There is no minimal example or proof-of-concept readily available.

## 2. Goals
*   To create the absolute simplest possible project to establish a baseline.
*   To demonstrate the ability to define, plan, and execute a trivial software task.
*   To provide a 'hello world' equivalent for our planning process.

## 3. Non-Goals
*   Developing a complex feature.
*   Implementing any business logic beyond the absolute minimum.
*   Creating a user interface.
*   Integrating with any external systems.
*   Deploying to production environments.

## 4. Success Criteria
*   A project plan for the 'Simple Project' is successfully created and approved.
*   The implementation plan for the 'Simple Project' is entirely executed.
*   All acceptance criteria for the 'Simple Project' are met.
*   The deliverable for the 'Simple Project' (e.g., a simple code artifact or documentation) is available.
