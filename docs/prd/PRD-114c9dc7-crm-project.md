Okay, great! We've established the project name as **RentRight CRM** and clarified the primary target of the CRM's data (car renters). We also highlighted the crucial distinction between *internal users* (employees) who operate the CRM and *external subjects* (car renters/customers) whose data is managed by it.

Based on our conversation so far, I will now construct a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for RentRight CRM. Please note that since specific details for target users, problems, features, and constraints have not yet been fully elaborated in our chat, I will make reasonable assumptions for a "fully functional CRM" tailored to a car rental company to provide a robust initial PRD structure. This document will serve as a foundational starting point that can be refined with more specific input.

# Product Requirements Document: RentRight CRM

**Project ID:** 114c9dc7
**Project Name:** RentRight CRM
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Product Manager

## 1. Executive Summary

RentRight CRM is a proposed Customer Relationship Management system designed specifically for a car rental company. The primary goal of this project is to implement a "fully functional CRM" to centralize customer data, streamline rental processes, improve customer engagement, and ultimately drive business growth for the car rental service. This system will serve as the single source of truth for all customer interactions, rental history, preferences, and communications, enabling more efficient operations and personalized customer experiences.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1. Vision
To empower car rental companies with a comprehensive, intuitive, and efficient CRM solution that transforms customer interactions into lasting relationships and optimized rental operations.

### 2.2. Goal
To implement a "fully functional CRM" that supports the entire customer journey for car renters, from initial inquiry to post-rental follow-up, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### 2.3. Project Scope
The scope encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of a web-based CRM application that caters to the specific needs of a car rental business. Integration with existing car rental management systems (if any) and potential third-party services (e.g., email, SMS) will be considered.

### 2.4. Project Name Rationale
"RentRight CRM" was chosen as it clearly and concisely communicates the system's purpose: managing customer relationships specifically within the car rental domain ("Rent") with an emphasis on correctness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction ("Right").

### 2.5. Target Users (Internal - Assumptions for a car rental company)
While specific roles are pending clarification, the RentRight CRM is envisioned to serve various internal stakeholders within the car rental company. These users will be the primary operators of the system.

*   **Rental Agents / Counter Staff:** Front-line staff responsible for bookings, check-ins, check-outs, and direct customer interactions.
*   **Customer Service Representatives:** Handle inquiries, resolve issues, and manage post-rental support.
*   **Sales & Reservation Team:** Manage lead generation, booking confirmations, and upselling.
*   **Marketing Team:** Plan and execute campaigns, analyze customer segments, and manage communications.
*   **Fleet Managers (Limited Interaction):** May use CRM for customer feedback related to specific vehicles or general customer sentiment related to fleet quality/availability.
*   **Management / Executives:** Oversee operations, analyze reports, and make strategic decisions.

### 2.6. Target Subjects (External - Car Renters)
The car renters are the customers whose data will be managed within the RentRight CRM. They will not directly log into the CRM but will be interacting with the company through its internal users, and their interactions will be recorded in the system.

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1. Architecture
*   **TC-ARC-1:** The system shall likely adopt a microservices architecture to allow for independent scaling and development of components.
*   **TC-ARC-2:** A cloud-native approach (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) is preferred for scalability and managed services.

### 7.2. Database
*   **TC-DB-1:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) seems appropriate for structured customer and rental data.
*   **TC-DB-2:** Consider NoSQL options for specific data types (e.g., interaction logs) if advantageous.

### 7.3. API Strategy
*   **TC-API-1:** Robust RESTful APIs will be designed for internal communication between microservices and external integrations.
*   **TC-API-2:** API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) shall be maintained.

### 7.4. Technology Stack (Proposed - subject to change)
*   **TC-TECH-1:** Backend: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express) or Java (Spring Boot).
*   **TC-TECH-2:** Frontend: React, Angular, or Vue.js for a responsive and modern user experience.
*   **TC-TECH-3:** Cloud Platform: AWS, Azure, or GCP.

### 7.5. Data Migration
*   **TC-DM-1:** A strategy for migrating existing customer and rental data from current systems (if any) will be required.
*   **TC-DM-2:** Data cleansing and deduplication processes will be part of the migration strategy.

### 7.6. Compliance
*   **TC-COMP-1:** All data handling and storage must comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **TC-COMP-2:** Payment card industry (PCI) compliance considerations for handling payment data.
