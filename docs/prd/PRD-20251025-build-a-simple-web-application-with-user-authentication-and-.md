# User Authentication and Data Storage Web Application

## Problem
Many web applications require a secure way to manage user access and persist user-specific data. Building these core features from scratch for every project is time-consuming and error-prone. We need a standardized and robust solution that provides basic user authentication (registration, login, logout) and a mechanism to store and retrieve data associated with authenticated users.

## Goals
1.  **Enable User Registration**: Allow new users to create an account with a unique username and password.
2.  **Enable User Login/Logout**: Provide functionality for authenticated users to log in and out securely.
3.  **Secure User Sessions**: Maintain secure user sessions after login to authorize access to protected resources.
4.  **Store User-Specific Data**: Allow authenticated users to store simple key-value or string-based data associated with their account.
5.  **Retrieve User-Specific Data**: Allow authenticated users to retrieve their previously stored data.
6.  **API-Driven**: Expose a clear and concise API for all user and data operations.

## Non-Goals
1.  **Password Reset/Recovery**: This initial version will not include features for forgotten passwords.
2.  **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA will not be supported in this iteration.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All authenticated users will have the same level of access to their own data.
4.  **Complex Data Structures**: The data storage will be simple, not supporting complex document structures, relationships, or advanced querying.
5.  **User Profile Management**: Beyond registration, there will be no features for updating user profiles (e.g., email, display name).
6.  **Frontend Implementation**: This PRD focuses solely on the backend API; a frontend is out of scope for this document.

## Success Criteria
1.  A new user can successfully register and their credentials are securely stored.
2.  An existing user can successfully log in and receive an authentication token/session identifier.
3.  An authenticated user can successfully log out, invalidating their session.
4.  An authenticated user can successfully store a new piece of data (`POST /api/data`).
5.  An authenticated user can successfully retrieve all their stored data (`GET /api/data`).
6.  Attempting to store or retrieve data without proper authentication results in an unauthorized error (401).
7.  Attempting to register with an existing username returns an appropriate error (e.g., 409 Conflict).
8.  The API responses are consistent and follow a predictable structure.
