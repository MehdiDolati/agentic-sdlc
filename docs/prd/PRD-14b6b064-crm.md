    *   **AC.CM.1.3:** Given I am viewing a contact record, when I click "Edit," I can modify existing information and save changes successfully.
    *   **AC.CM.1.4:** Given I am viewing a contact record, when I click "Delete," a confirmation dialog appears, and upon confirmation, the contact record is removed from the system.
*   **FR.LM.3: Users shall be able to convert Leads into Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities.**
    *   **AC.LM.3.1:** Given I am viewing a Lead record with sufficient information, when I click "Convert Lead," I am prompted to create a new Contact, Account, and/or Opportunity.
    *   **AC.LM.3.2:** Upon successful conversion, the original Lead record's status is updated to "Converted" or similar, and the new Contact, Account, and/or Opportunity records are created and linked.

### 7. Technical Considerations

#### 7.1 Architecture
*   **Cloud-Native:** The system will be built on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to leverage scalability, elasticity, and managed services.
*   **Microservices-based:** A microservices architecture will be employed to ensure modularity, independent deployment, and scalability of individual components (e.g., Contact Service, Sales Service, Marketing Service).
*   **API-First Design:** All functionality will be exposed via well-documented APIs to facilitate internal consumption and external integrations.

#### 7.2 Technology Stack (Proposed - Needs User Validation/Dev Team Input)
*   **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express) with a robust ORM.
*   **Frontend:** ReactJS or Vue.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data, possibly combined with NoSQL for specific use cases (e.g., activity logs, marketing campaign data).
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3, SQS, Lambda) for infrastructure and managed services.
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab).
*   **Containerization:** Docker & Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration.
*   **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.

#### 7.3 Data Model
*   The core data model will include entities such as Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Opportunities, Activities (Tasks, Calls, Meetings), Emails, and Cases.
*   Relationships between entities will be clearly defined (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
*   Schema design will prioritize flexibility for custom fields and future extensions.

#### 7.4 Integrations
*   A robust API will be developed for programmatic access and extension.
*   Webhooks will be supported for real-time data synchronization with external systems.
*   OAuth 2.0 or similar will be used for secure third-party authentications.
