# Title: User Authentication and Profile Management

## 1. Problem
Users currently lack a unified and secure way to register, log in, and manage their personal information within our application. The absence of these core features hinders user engagement, personalization, and the ability to implement future functionalities that rely on user identity.

## 2. Goals
*   Enable new users to register securely with an email and password.
*   Allow existing users to log in and out securely.
*   Provide users with the ability to view and update their profile information (e.g., name, email).
*   Implement secure password handling, including hashing and reset functionality.
*   Establish a foundation for role-based access control (RBAC) and personalized experiences.

## 3. Non-Goals
*   Integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
*   Complex multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Advanced email verification systems beyond initial registration confirmation.
*   Real-time profile updates or notifications.
*   User account deletion functionality (will be addressed in a future iteration).

## 4. Success Criteria
*   95% successful user registration rate.
*   99% successful login rate for existing users.
*   Less than 0.1% reported security incidents related to authentication within the first three months of launch.
*   Average time for users to update their profile information is under 30 seconds.
*   All API endpoints for authentication and profile management are secured and perform within acceptable latency limits (e.g., <500ms response time).
