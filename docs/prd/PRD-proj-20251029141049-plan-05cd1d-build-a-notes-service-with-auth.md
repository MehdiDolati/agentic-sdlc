Okay, let's get started! To build a comprehensive PRD for "Build a notes service with auth", I need to gather more detailed information. Please provide answers to the questions I posed:

**Please tell me more about:**

*   **Who are your target users?** (e.g., individuals, small teams, enterprise users, developers, students, professionals, etc. What are their technical proficiencies?)
*   **What main problems does this solve?** (e.g., disorganization, lack of collaboration, insecure data storage, difficulty accessing notes across devices, inability to share securely, etc.)
*   **What are the core features you envision?** (e.g., create/edit/delete notes, search, rich text editing, tagging, sharing, version history, authentication methods, etc.)
*   **Any specific constraints or requirements?** (e.g., budget, technology stack preferences, compliance needs, security standards, mobile-first design, high availability, specific scalability targets, integration requirements, etc.)

Once you provide this information, I can generate the detailed PRD for you. I'm ready for your input!
