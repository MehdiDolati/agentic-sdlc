# Project sfdg

## 1. Problem
The current system lacks a clear project definition and an understanding of its purpose, leading to potential misallocation of resources and unfocused development efforts.

## 2. Goals
* To establish a foundational understanding of the "sfdg" project.
* To define the scope and initial objectives of "sfdg" clearly.
* To provide a basis for future planning and development of "sfdg".

## 3. Non-Goals
* This PRD will not define specific technical implementations or architectural details.
* This PRD will not detail individual tasks or user stories.
* This PRD will not include a timeline or resource allocation plan.

## 4. Success Criteria
* A consensus on the purpose and brief description of "sfdg" is reached amongst stakeholders.
* This PRD is formally approved by relevant project leads.
* Future discussions and planning for "sfdg" can clearly reference this document.
