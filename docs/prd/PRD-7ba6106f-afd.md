It seems there was a misunderstanding, or the conversation history was incomplete. The only information I have about your project is "Project Description: afds". I need more details about the project "afd" to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).

To help me generate the PRD, please provide answers to the questions I previously asked:

*   **Who are your target users?**
*   **What main problems does this solve?**
*   **What are the core features you envision?**
*   **Any specific constraints or requirements?**

Once you provide this information, I can proceed with creating a detailed PRD with all the requested sections.
