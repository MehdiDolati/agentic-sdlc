# Office Automation Project

## Problem
Manual, repetitive tasks within the office environment lead to inefficiencies, increased errors, and decreased employee productivity and satisfaction. Current processes often lack standardization and a centralized system for tracking and managing routine operations.

## Goals
*   To automate routine office tasks to reduce manual effort.
*   To improve the speed and accuracy of common office procedures.
*   To enhance employee productivity and free up time for higher-value activities.
*   To establish a more standardized and streamlined approach to office operations.

## Non-Goals
*   Replacing human decision-making for complex, non-routine tasks.
*   Developing a full-fledged Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
*   Automating highly specialized departmental operations not common across the general office.

## Success Criteria
*   Reduction in time spent on identified manual tasks by at least 30% within 6 months of deployment.
*   Error rate for automated processes decreases by 50% compared to manual processes.
*   90% user satisfaction with the automation tools based on post-implementation surveys.
*   Successful integration with existing key office software (e.g., email, calendar) as specified.
*   All defined automation workflows are fully operational and stable.
