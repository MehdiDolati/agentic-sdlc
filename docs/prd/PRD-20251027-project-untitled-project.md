# Untitled Project: Plan and Feature Prioritization

## 1. Problem
The current project lacks a clear, prioritized plan and detailed feature descriptions. This can lead to scope creep, inefficient resource allocation, and a lack of focus during development.

## 2. Goals
*   Establish a definitive, prioritized list of plans and features.
*   Provide clear descriptions and size estimates for each item.
*   Ensure logical sequencing of implementation.
*   Facilitate efficient resource planning and development.

## 3. Non-Goals
*   Detailed technical design of individual features.
*   Specific UI/UX mockups.
*   Project timelines or Gantt charts (this document focuses on prioritization and sequencing).

## 4. Success Criteria
*   All key stakeholders agree on the prioritized list of plans and features.
*   Development teams have a clear understanding of what needs to be built and in what order.
*   The project proceeds with a reduced risk of scope creep due to a well-defined scope.
*   Resource allocation is demonstrably more efficient based on the established priorities.
