The user has not provided enough information to create a comprehensive PRD. The current description is "This is simply a new project." I need to elicit more details from the user regarding the target audience, problems to solve, core features, and any constraints.

Once the user provides this information, I will synthesize it into the requested PRD format.

**(To the user):** Thank you for initiating the process! To create a truly comprehensive and useful PRD for "a new project," I need a bit more detail. Please provide answers to the questions I posed:

*   **Who are your target users?** (e.g., small businesses, developers, general consumers, specific age groups, etc.)
*   **What main problems does this solve?** (What pain points or needs does your project address?)
*   **What are the core features you envision?** (What are the essential functionalities users will interact with?)
*   **Any specific constraints or requirements?** (e.g., budget, technology stack, compliance, performance, integration needs, etc.)

Once I have this information, I can generate the detailed PRD as requested.
